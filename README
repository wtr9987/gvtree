                       Abstract

gvtree is a graphical git version tree browser written C++ 
for Linux platform using Qt libraries. The main focus is
the review of repositories, rather than changing code and
developing. The main functionality is to select a node in
the version graph and compare it to the current HEAD version,
the direct predecessors or a selected version. Additionally 
a comparison between the current local changes and the local
HEAD version is possible. A version history of a individual
file can be viewed as well.

Parameters:
[path]
   Set a file constraint. The version tree of the file will
   be displayed.

-r [local git repository directory]
   If not specified the current path is checked for a valid repository
   or the repository used in the previous session is displayed.
   Which one is used can be controlled by the preferences setting.

--version Version string is printed to stdout

--silent true|false Silent mode.
   If true, commands are not printed to stdout. The preferences
   'print commandline to stdout' is set to this value.

--css [style sheet file]
   Load a css style sheet file.
   If not specified the last file used will be taken.
   Perhaps it is a good idea to copy gvtree.css to ~/.config/gvtree
   and run ./gvtree --css ~/.config/gvtree/gvtree.css once.

-t Testing:
   Display the test tree graph from (3).

-f [gitlog] 
   Testing:
   Load a file created with 
     git log --graph --pretty="#%h#%at#%an#%d#%s#"
   This has been helpful during development to import constraint and
   complex repository data.

-h This information.
